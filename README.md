## Why was it made?
1. I wanted to flex my "vanilla" javascript muscle. That is to say, I wanted to make
    a piece of software with Javascript without having any of the processes abstracted away
    by libraries or frameworks. I wanted to build a piece of software that is complex enough
    that some thought has to go into the maths, data structures, performance, and visual appeal
    with just the base JS/HTML/CSS components.
2. When it comes to programming I love technically complex software that is either user facing, is
    involved in art in some way, or a combination of the two.
    Examples include Digital Software Workstations (DAWs), Virtual Studio Technology apps (VSTs),
    drawing applications, emulators, and websites (when they're made well). I was curious as to how
    drawing applications work, so I took the plunge.
